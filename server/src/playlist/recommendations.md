# Music Recommendation Algorithm - Technical Concepts

## Overview

This document outlines the conceptual approach behind a music recommendation system. The recommendation service analyzes audio features of songs within a playlist to suggest similar tracks that a user might enjoy.

## Core Concepts

### Feature Analysis

The recommendation engine works by analyzing several audio features for each song, including:

- Danceability
- Energy
- Tempo
- Valence (musical positivity)
- Acousticness
- Instrumentalness

These features provide a multi-dimensional representation of each song's musical characteristics.

### Similarity Calculation

To find song recommendations:

1. The system identifies songs not currently in the playlist
2. Computes a similarity score between each candidate song and the playlist profile
3. Uses a weighted distance calculation that prioritizes certain features over others
4. Transforms this distance into a score where higher values indicate greater similarity
5. Returns the top-scoring songs as recommendations
